# 🐱 CatSwitch

**CatSwitch** is a fun and interactive web project that allows users to toggle a virtual light ON or OFF — with a cute cat theme! 💡🐾  
It’s a creative blend of design, animation, and simple JavaScript logic.

## 🎯 Project Objective
- To simulate a light switch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- To create a visually engaging and fun experience featuring a cat and a glowing bulb.  
- To demonstrate DOM manipulation and basic UI interactivity.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Clone the repository**
   git clone https://github.com/spoorthi-keerthi/CatSwitch.git


## How It Works

The JavaScript script listens for button clicks.
When “ON” is clicked, it changes the light bulb image/style to a glowing state and updates the text to “Switched On.”
When “OFF” is clicked, the bulb turns off, and the text changes to “Switched Off.”
